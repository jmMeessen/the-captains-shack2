Over the years, I got interested and passionate in many fields. Some of them were discovered as part of my retiring plan.
This site is mainly to collect notes and ideas for my own. But others might be interested.
This is just an idea of what I am interested in:

<br/>

_Ham radio (Telegraphy, QRP, SOTA/POTA/WWFF)_

_Genealogy_

_History with an interest in reenactment_

_Ornithology and nature preservation_

_Computing, programming (my latest programming language of choice is Golang)_

_Bread making, sourdough, wood oven_

_(Vegetable) gardening and permaculture_ 

_Scything_

_Discovering my new country of adoption: Normandy_

_and many other topic_

<br/>

**Enjoy!**
